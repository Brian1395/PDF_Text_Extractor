# PDF_Text_Extractor
 
I wanted to make a neural net from scratch but using a precollected set of handwritten digits as my training data seemed to mainstream. However, I don't have the time to manually write and photograph tens of thousands of digits, so I decided to use typed digits. I was hoping that they would a) be easier to identify and b) be easier to collect, which would mean I needed less training data which I could aquire faster. I do like having some (semi)useful result of my work so I decided to focus of an end goal of a neural network that could extract the characters from a PDF I had for my Spanish class. First I wrote a program to automate a lot of the training data collection process, and now I'm focusing on building the network itself. I wanted to do it as from scratch as posible, not using any existing machine learning libraries. Using an established dataset would probably have made the rest of this easier by removing a confounding variable (how garbage my dataset is), but I'm down for a challenge.
